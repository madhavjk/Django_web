          Standford researchers find a quicker,<br />
          cheaper way to sort isotopes

          BY EMMANUEL ROMERO L.A. Cicero Richard Zare<br />
          Professor Richard Zare in his lab. Whether it's the summer<br />
          grass that tickles your feet or the red Bordeaux smacking on<br />
          your palate,nearly every part of the world around you carries<br />
          special chemical markers.These markers, called isotopes,can<br />
          tell scientists where the molecules that compose a substance<br />
          are from,where they travelled and what happened to them<br />
          along the way.But doing these analyses has been complex<br />
          and costly.Now,Standford chemists have developed a new<br />
          method to make isotopic analysis easier and less expensive.
